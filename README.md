# EE148_Style_Transfer

Final project for Caltech EE 148: Topics in Computational Vision. In this project, I explore style transfer using neural networks. To run:

- Store the desired content and style images as `style.jpg` and `content.jpg` in the desired directory.
- Invoke the following command: `python src/style_transfer.py <dir_path>`

Adapted from the [Keras example implementation](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py) of style transfer.
