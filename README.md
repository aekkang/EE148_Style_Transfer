# EE148_Style_Transfer

Final project for Caltech EE 148: Topics in Computational Vision. In this project, I explore style transfer using neural networks. To run:

- Store the desired content and style images as `content.jpg` and `style.jpg`, respectively, in the desired directory.
- Invoke the following command: `python src/style_transfer.py <dir_path>`

For a list of available options, invoke `python src/style_transfer.py --h`.

For more information on the experiments and explorations I made for the project, see [my presentation](presentation.pdf) and [my report](report.pdf).

Adapted from the [Keras example implementation](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py) of style transfer.
